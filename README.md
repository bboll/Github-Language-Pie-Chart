# Github-Language-Pie-Chart
Pulls your Github repo data and generates a pie chart showing programming language makeup. Uses Github authentication.

**Project status:** Currently converting from something I used once for myself to a tool others can use

Hosted here currently: http://www.brianboll.com/piechart/piechart.php

Example of what mine looked like:

**Future endeavors:** Use a library like D3.js for better image resolutions and more options. Build a front-end allowing users to generate their own with different options like font size, show/hide percentages, etc.
